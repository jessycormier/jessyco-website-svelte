Welcome to the first post! 
This has been a long time in the making. 
I've always been interested in writing a blog or making content but for one reason or another I found myself busy with other projects or ideas.

I've had blogs before and created content on the web starting as far back as 2005.
Starting with a website that had posts as well as tutorials I've written on programming and photo editing tricks.

So I'm back at it in 2022. 
This rebuild of my personal website is to give myself a digital garden for sharing knowledge and personal growth.
