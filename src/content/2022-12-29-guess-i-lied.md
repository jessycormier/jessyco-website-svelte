So it turns out I didn't stick with Angular... 
and I kinda just went all in on this *Svlete + Sveltekit* thing.

I've spent 20 some hours on this creative endevor but I can say it's been a blast. 
Learning Svelte and getting the context switching from SSR and client will be a continued challenge however the ease and fun writing components is makes this very interesting to keep using for the time being.

I've been able to make a neat thing where I can generate a low poly background like

<img src="/polybg/80x80/jessy.svg" alt="example of polybg api" />

and control the size easily. This is what I'm using for these blog posts images for now to give the site a bit more life.

That's it for now. We'll see if I can get this stuff filled up with useful information soon.
